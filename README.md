# Machine Learning Project for the Course by Burdos Team

This project, type B, tests different kinds of models implemented in Python using various libraries. All the models are developed for two distinct assignments: MONKS and Cup datasets.

## Models Used

The following models are used in this project:

- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
- SVM (Support Vector Machines)
- NN using Keras libraries
- NN using scikit-learn
- Our custom model implementation
- Ensemble model using the weighted average of the models

## Notebooks

The project includes the following Jupyter notebooks:

- `KNN.ipynb`: Implementation of the KNN model
- `SVM.ipynb`: Implementation of the SVM model
- `NN_Keras.ipynb`: Implementation of the Neural Network using Keras
- `NN_sklearn.ipynb`: Implementation of the Neural Network using scikit-learn
- `NNN_notebook.ipynb`: Our custom Neural Network model implementation
- `Ensemble.ipynb`: Implementation of the Ensemble model
- `Data_preparation.ipynb`: Data analysis and preprocessing of the datasets

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `code/`: Contains utility functions used for models, data handling, and data visualization
- `models/`: Contains the Jupyter notebooks for each model implementation
- `data/`: Contains the MONKS and Cup datasets (not included in the repository)

## Requirements

To run the notebooks and code in this project, you need the following dependencies:

Python == 3.10.0 or more
Numpy == 1.26.4
Tensorflow == 2.16.1
Pandas == 2.2.2
Seaborn == 0.13.2
Matplotlib == 3.8.4
Scikit-learn == 1.4.2
Keras == 3.3.2
Scikeras == 0.13.0

## Results

The performance of each model on the MONKS and Cup datasets is evaluated and compared. The evaluation metrics used include accuracy fot the MONKs datasets and Mean Euclidean Error (MEE) for the Cup dataset. The results are presented in the respective notebooks and in the slides.
